### Comments from testers
- Well made and fun game. Like how you have implemented yourselves as players.  
- Would've been nice with an option after you died or won the game where you can choose to restart instead of just restarting immediately. 
- Instructions of how you win, should I pick up all the stars? 
- Simply written code that's easy to understand.
- Remember to remove the files you don't use. For example: "erik.png" images and the "test.json" maps in the "assets" folder.
